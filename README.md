# NAND_multiply_algo
Python code that writes NAND code to multiply two 512bit numbers. NAND is a langauge that only has the operator NAND as in Not And. 


Mediumly efficient solution. Some optimizing could be done for example printing out individual bit immediately instead of saving and then outputting it. Moroever storing all the numbers in a table with loads of extra 0's to make sure the numbers are in the right space is reduntant one just needs to take into account the shifting when you are adding.
